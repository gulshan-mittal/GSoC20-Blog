<p>My mentor and I decided the <strong>tasks</strong> for this week given as :
* Need to Discuss/Think more about the default Caption value
* Need to Discuss/Think more about the default Caption display for the unaligned context</p>

<p>Apart from this, I have decided to add the following features
* CRUD for the Admins
    * Can see all the experiments
    * Can add user 
    * Delete User
    * Check experiments for each users
    * See profile of Each User
* Added Gravatars for each user to make the UI attractive</p>

<p>In this week and the next week I will be adding details of each feature along with screenshots as I completed them.</p>

<h3 id="caption-display-for-unaligned-tagged-query-context">Caption Display for Unaligned Tagged Query Context</h3>

<p>So as per discussion with my mentor <strong>Peter Uhrig</strong>, we have decided to display some particular number of words per second relative to before time and after time. So I have made a button which takes user input the number of words they want to display per second for unaligned query contexts.</p>

<p>The following is the screenshot for that:</p>
