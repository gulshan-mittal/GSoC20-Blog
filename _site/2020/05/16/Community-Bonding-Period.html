<p>Working during Community Period is Awesome and is a great experience to me. This post includes my work which I have done during community period bonding i.e Pre-GSoC Phase Period. I utilized the community bonding period to discuss the deliverables with my mentors <strong>Peter Uhrig</strong>, <strong>Anna Wilson</strong>, and <strong>Vaibhav Gupta</strong>.</p>

<p>Also the I am very glad that I was a part of cohort meeting organized by <strong>Mark Turner</strong>.</p>
