This task is aimed at extending the [Red Hen RapidAnnotator-2.0](https://github.com/RedHenLab/RapidAnnotator-2.0), which was re-implemented from scratch as a Python/Flask application during last year's GSoC. This project mainly aims to deliver a fully usable and handy product by the end of Google Code of Summer and incorporation of [new feature request and bug fixes](https://sites.google.com/case.edu/techne-public-site/red-hen-rapid-annotator). The final product would be a complete tool for fast and simple classification of datasets and a administrative interface for the experimenters where they can conduct their annotation runs. It broadly comprises of 3 steps, namely

*   Uploading their datasets to setup the experiment.
*   Assigning annotators datasets for annotation.
*   Keeping a track of the annotation progress.
