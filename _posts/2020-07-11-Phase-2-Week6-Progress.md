My mentor and I decided the **tasks** for this week given as :

Apart from this, I have decided to add the following features
* CRUD for the Admins
    * Can see all the experiemnts
    * Can add user 
    * Delete User
    * Check experiments for each users
    * See profile of Each User
* Added Gravatars for each user to make the UI attractive

In this week and the next week I will be adding details of each feature along with screenshots as I completed them.
