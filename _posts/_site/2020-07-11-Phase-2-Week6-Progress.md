My mentor and I decided the **tasks** for this week given as :
* Need to Discuss/Think more about the default Caption value
* Need to Discuss/Think more about the default Caption display for the unaligned context

Apart from this, I have decided to add the following features
* CRUD for the Admins
    * Can see all the experiments
    * Can add user 
    * Delete User
    * Check experiments for each users
    * See profile of Each User
* Added Gravatars for each user to make the UI attractive

In this week and the next week I will be adding details of each feature along with screenshots as I completed them.

### Caption Display for Unaligned Tagged Query Context

So as per discussion with my mentor **Peter Uhrig**, we have decided to display some particular number of words per second relative to before time and after time. So I have made a button which takes user input the number of words they want to display per second for unaligned query contexts.

The following is the screenshot for that:
