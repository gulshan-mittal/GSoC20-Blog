### Milestones for Next Week

My mentor and I decided the **tasks** for the next week given as :

* Create a Input and Output CSV file as a sample for integrating Clustering 
* Create a framework to integrate Clustering Algorithm in Rapid Annotator 2.0
  * Check if clustering has been done or not so that user can start the annotation process once it gets finish
  * Ensure that user can do clustering again on clustered output.
