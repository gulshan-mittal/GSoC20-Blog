Working during Community Period is Awesome and is a great experience to me. This post includes my work which I have done during community period bonding i.e Pre-GSoC Phase Period. I utilized the community bonding period to discuss the deliverables with my mentors **Peter Uhrig**, **Anna Wilson**, and **Vaibhav Gupta**.

Also the I am very glad that I was a part of cohort meeting organized by **Mark Turner**.
