### Selective Annotation

In this, I have added a feature called selective annotation. In the results page you can now directly annotate the specific file whether it was already annotated or not. **Follow the below steps** for performing selective annotation.

* First visit the result page. Then click on the filename for the file you want to annotate.

* If the file is already annotated then it will show the current annotation labels as well as a guidance to the annotator. See the red label button and info on the left.

* It will also show that if the particular level was skipped or not.

* After completing the annotation process you will see the following screen. Click on the back button to view the update results
